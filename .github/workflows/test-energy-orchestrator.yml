name: Run Tests (Energy Orchestrator)

# Uses pull_request_target to avoid requiring approval for every PR from forks/first-time contributors.
# This is safe because:
# 1. The workflow only has read permissions (contents: read)
# 2. No secrets are exposed to the workflow
# 3. The workflow only runs pytest tests in an isolated environment
